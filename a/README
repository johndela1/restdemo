must have redis on localhost must have postgresql on localhost with a
db named 'guid' that uses schema.sql

run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (I suggest doing this in a
virtual env)

to run tests: python ./tests.py

to run server: python ./server.py (listens on port 5000)

This server is very barebones, just wanted to see if I could figure out
the async stuff.  Not sure how idiomatic it is, but it seems to work.

Only methods supported are POST and GET.
