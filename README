The most complete implementation is in the directory named synchronous.
After getting that working, I looked at the Python 3.7 asyncio stuff
and started working on a partial implementation in the directory named
asynchronous.  The asynchronous stuff is more of a proof of concept that
I can get me head around the Python asyncio model to some degree.
